## Triangles (Python/Batch)
Scripting language based project, created in winter 2022/23

The program's purpose is to check if, in a given array of side lengths, a triplet exists that would satisfy the Traingle's condtition
(sum of lengths of 2 smaller sides must be bigger than the length of the longest side)

`menu.bat` opens the console-based menu, from which we can run the scripts, check information about the program and create backups.

Testcases are to be placed in the in folder and named inX.txt, substituting X for a number. The program run the calculations for the testcases and returns results in the out folder.
Additionally, an html file `report.html` is created in the main directory, as a styled summary of results.
By choosing `Make Backup`, the html file and a collective txt report are copied to backup folder with date and hour as name.
